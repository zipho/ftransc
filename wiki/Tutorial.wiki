#summary ftransc Installation Instructions and Usage Tutorial

= What is ftransc =

ftransc is a script written in python for the Linux-based operating systems 
for converting audio files across various formats.

From version 4.1.0, there is a GUI front-end to ftransc which is called ftransc_qt. 

== ftransc Dependencies ==

The dependencies for ftransc are:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mutagen mutagen] - for metadata handling
  * [http://www.ffmpeg.org ffmpeg] - for decoding all input multimedia files and encoding to  wma format.
  * [http://lame.sourceforge.net lame] - for encoding to mp3 format.
  * [http://flac.sourceforge.net flac] - for encoding to flac format.
  * [http://www.vorbis.com vorbis-tools] - for encoding to ogg format.
  * [http://www.audiocoding.com faac] - for encoding to aac format (with .m4a extension).
  * [http://www.musepack.net mppenc] - for encoding to musepack format (.mpc extension).
  * [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro PyQt4] - for the GUI front-end, ftransc_qt.

== Installing ftransc == 

Install dependencies, including subversion, on Terminal using apt-get as follows.
{{{
    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg lame flac faac vorbis-tools python-mutagen mppenc subversion python-qt4
}}}

OPTION A. Obtain the latest released ftransc tarball version from [http://code.google.com/p/ftransc/downloads/list ftransc] website and unpack and install it as follows:
{{{
    tar xvzf ftransc-x.y.z.tar.gz
    cd ftransc-x.y.z
    sudo make uninstall
    sudo make install
}}}
OPTION B. Obtain the latest ftransc code from trunk using subversion as follows.
{{{
    cd /tmp
    svn export http://ftransc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk ftransc_tmp_dir
    cd ftransc_tmp_dir
    sudo make uninstall
    sudo make install
}}}
OPTION C. If you already have ftransc of version 4.0.5 or higher and intend to upgrade to the lastest available version in trunk, you can use the --upgrade option of ftransc as follows.
{{{
    sudo ftransc --upgrade
}}}

Now you should be able to run ftransc from terminal. You use ftransc to check if the dependencies it needs are installed or not as follows:
{{{
    ftransc --check
}}}

For further ftransc help:
{{{
    man ftransc
    ftransc --help
}}}

== How ftransc Works == 

ftransc should be invoked/run on Terminal, typically in a syntax like 
*ftransc options files*. ftransc will convert one file at a time and 
followed by the next one, until all input files are converted.

Conversion steps:

 # A lockfile corresponding to the input file is created, if it exists already, then the file is skipped because its already locked.
 # Then, the metadata tags are copied from the input file. Not all tags are copied, only *title*, *artist*, *album*, *genre*, *track number*, and album/song release *date/year* are copied. The character encoding used to handle metadata tags is UTF-8.
 # The input file is converted to the the desired audio format. The input file is not changed in any way. 
 # When the second step, above, has finised successfully, the metadata tags that were copied, if any, are then inserted into the newly created file.
 # A lockfile corresponding to the input file is deleted.
 # If an option to remove the original file is specified and if the conversion process has finished successfully, the original file is deleted.
 # Note: If step any of steps 2 to 4 has caused ftransc to terminate before reaching step 5, a lockfile will still exist. Further attempts to encode a file with a lockfile existing will cause that file to be skipped. To remove the lockfile use the '-u' option.

== ftransc Examples ==

Example 1 - converting from MP3 to OGG:
{{{
    ftransc -f ogg filename.mp3
}}}
The output file name for the above example will be 'filename.ogg'

Example 2 - converting from MP3 to AAC, removing original file on success, using high quality preset:
{{{
    ftransc -r -q extreme -f aac filename.mp3
}}}

Example 3 - extract audio content from a video files into the MP3 format, use best quality preset:
{{{
    ftransc -q insane -f mp3 filename1.flv filename2.avi filename3.mpg filename4.vob ...
}}}

Example 4 - convert all audio files inside a given folder into WMA format. (This option is not recursive to child-folders)
{{{
    ftransc -f wma --directory /path/to/folder_name
}}}

Example 5 - convert all audio audio files (and extract all audio content from video files) inside a given folder recursively including all sub-/child-folders, ftransc should be used with the 'find' command in the pipeline as follows:
{{{
    find /path/to/folder_name -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ftransc -f aac -q high
}}}

== ftransc Quality Presets == 

ftransc uses quality presets called 'insane', 'extreme', 'high', 'normal', 'low', and 'tiny'. These presets are specified by the '-q' or '--quality' option of ftransc and are defined in the '/etc/ftransc/presets.conf' configuration file. 

The '/etc/ftransc/presets.conf' presets file can be overriden by use of the --presets option and specify the custom presets file to use or, if you know what you are doing, make changes directly on the it.

The contents of the presets.conf file can be viewed [http://code.google.com/p/ftransc/source/browse/trunk/config/presets.conf here]

== ftransc Metadata Tags == 

The following is the list of supported tags across audio formats that ftransc can encode to. N means the tag is not supported and hence is lost during conversion. Y means the tag is supported and is present on the new file after conversion:

|| *tag* || *m4a* || *mp3* || *ogg* || *flac* || *wma* || *mpc* || *wav* ||
|| title  || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || N ||
|| artist || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || N ||
|| album  || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || N ||
|| genre  || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || N ||
|| date   || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || N ||
|| tracknumber || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || N ||
|| composer    || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || Y || N ||
|| publisher   || N || Y || N || N || Y || N || N ||
