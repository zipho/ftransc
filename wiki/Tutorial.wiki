#summary Details on how to use ftransc

= The ftransc Tutorial=

ftransc is a script written in python for the linux operating system 
for converting audio files across various formats.

The dependencies for ftransc are:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mutagen mutagen] - for metadata handling
  * ffmpeg - for decoding all input multimedia files and encoding to  wma format.
  * lame - for encoding to mp3 format.
  * flac - for encoding to flac format.
  * vorbis-tools - for encoding to ogg format.
  * faac - for encoding to aac format (with .m4a extension).

== How ftransc Works == 

ftransc should be invoked/run on Terminal, typically in a syntax like 
*ftransc options files*. ftransc will convert one file at a time and 
followed by the next one, untill all input files are converted.

 # A lockfile corresponding to the input file is created, if it exists already, then the file is skipped because its already locked.
 # Then, the metadata tags are copied from the input file. Not all tags are copied, only *title*, *artist*, *album*, *genre*, *track number*, and album/song release *date/year* are copied.
 # The input file is converted to the the destination format. The input file is not changed in any way. 
 # When the second step, above, has finised successfully, the metadata tags that were copied, if any, are then inserted into the newly created file.
 # A lockfile corresponding to the input file is deleted.
 # If an option to remove the original file is specified and if the conversion process has finished successfully, the original file is deleted.

== ftransc Examples ==

Example 2 - converting from MP3 to AAC, removing original file on success, using high quality preset:
{{{
    ftransc -r -q extreme -f aac filename.mp3
}}}

Example 3 - extract audio content from a video files into the MP3 format, use best quality preset:
{{{
    ftransc -q insane -f mp3 filename1.flv filename2.avi filename3.mpg filename4.vob ...
}}}

Example 4 - convert all audio files inside a given folder into WMA format
